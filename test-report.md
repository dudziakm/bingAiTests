## Summary

This document summarizes the results of the automated tests run on Bing AI.

## Test Execution Details

- **Date:** 22/06/2024
- **Browser:** Chromium
- **Platform:** Linux
- **Total Tests:** 8 independent. One of them is run 5 times to check different possible responses. So in total, we have 12 test runs.
- **Passed:** 9
- **Failed:** 2
- **Flaky:** 1
- **Skipped:** 0

## Detailed Results

### Failed Tests

- `mathVerification.spec.ts: › Check Basic Bing Copilot elements › should do a simple math: 2 + 2 × 2 ÷ 2`
- `mathVerification.spec.ts › Check Basic Bing Copilot elements › should do a simple math: 3 + 5 × 2 ÷ 4 - 1`

## Conclusion

The overall performance is not perfect. I needed to add a few fluid/flexible timeouts to the tests.

### Areas Needing Improvement

- In the application, we can add more meaningful IDs to the page elements. Currently, it is hard to find elements.
- Maybe there is an option to add some indication that answer generation is finished. Currently, it is hard to find out from tests when it is done.

### Next Steps

- Automate More Complex Scenarios: Identify and automate more complex user interactions and scenarios to ensure comprehensive coverage.
- Load Testing: Introduce load testing to understand how the application performs under stress and high user load.
- Accessibility Testing: Ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities by incorporating accessibility tests.
- Cross-Browser and Cross-Device Testing: Expand testing to include other browsers and devices to ensure consistent performance and user experience across different environments.
- We can check more questions manually, which are harder to automate.

Further suggestions and ideas for improvement will be added in the "Possible Enhancements" section.
